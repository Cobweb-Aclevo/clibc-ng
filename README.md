# Clibc-ng
A new generation libc extension/wrapper written in Modern C.

### What is Modern C?
Modern C is an improved-upon version of C, with a different programming style and better programming practices. Modern C is faster, more secure and easier to read compared to standard C.\
[See this talk for reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpAhX-gsHMs)

### Why should i use Clibc-ng ?
Clibc-ng is easier to read compared to the classic libc. Clibc offers more optimised maths and string operations. Clibc also comes with jemalloc memory allocation for more efficient memory allocation. It also aids with memory fragmentation.
